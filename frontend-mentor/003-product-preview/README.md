## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Styling responsive images.

### Continued development

- Maybe recreate in css-grid to practice grid layout too.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This helped me to implement responsive images. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
